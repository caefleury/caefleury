# Hey, I'm Caetano 👋🏽

I'm a Computer Science student who loves solving problems through code — especially when it involves data, AI, or building systems from scratch. I started my journey in web development, working on fullstack projects using JavaScript, TypeScript, .NET, and modern frameworks like React and Next.js.

Over time, I became increasingly interested in artificial intelligence and data-intensive systems. Today, my focus is on data engineering, machine learning, and AI applications, where I work with tools like Python, FastAPI, MongoDB, Airflow, and explore concepts like LLMs, diffusion models, vector databases, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

I'm passionate about learning by building — whether it's a predictive model, an API, or an end-to-end pipeline. Always exploring, always improving. Let’s connect or check out some of my projects 🚀
